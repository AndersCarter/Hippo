Shakespeare's Monkeys
There is a popular anecdote about that if you give a monkey a type writer and a give it enough time. It can write a work of Shakespeare. This is the basic idea behind this program. What it does is using a genetic algorithm it creates random strings and then evolves them using general Darwinian evolution. That is, a genepool of a given population size is created and then the more fit of the genepool have a greater chance of mating and passing their DNA along to the next generation. This example the more correct strings will be more fit and will mate with other strings that are also fit. Eventually after hundreds and thousands of generations the target/given string is generated. While contrived this program does show the basics and power of genetic algorithms.

The problem is from Daniel Shiffman's The Nature of Code Chapter 9 - Genetic Algorithms.
